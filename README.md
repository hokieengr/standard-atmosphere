Standard Atmosphere Model(s)

This project aims to collect standard atmosphere models with a focus on usability and simplicity. This is not a project to document the world's various models but rather a small collection of simple, robust, and common models ready for integration into other projects.

The goals of this project are as follows:
 * Simple
 * No dependencies
 * Robust
 * Portable
